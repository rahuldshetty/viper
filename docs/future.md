# Future <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

I have built this project by learning the concepts of Compiler designing and based on a language called "clox" from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com). The author of this book, Robert Nystorm has come up with great exercise materials for the readers to implement in their language. Some of these are added feature that will make Viper more robust and almost production equivalent to modern day languages. I will be working on some of these enhancements.

Following are the high-level topics that I want to implement in Viper:
1. Support for native functions to manage data types:
    1. Add functionality to append items to list.
    2. Data type casting functions.
    3. Basic support for mathematical functions from C's math.h library.
2. Support for break/continue jump statements.
3. Expand internal limits for stack and other objects.
4. File object and functions.
5. Error handling.
6. Ternary Operator.
7. String interpolation.

and many more....
